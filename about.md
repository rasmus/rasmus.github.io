title: About me
---

I am a passionate software engineer that likes to do things properly. I stride to maintain
a high quality in all software solutions that I work on, both privately and professionally.
Also, it’s my belief that high quality software is not just about a good performance and
low bug count, but a good overall design, easy to read code and good documentation is
also essential fundaments to maintain a good code base.

Privately I’m a caring person that likes to be with friends and be there when they need me.

##### EventFlow
In March 2015 I started developing a open source async/await first, CQRS+ES
framework called [EventFlow](https://github.com/rasmus/EventFlow) for the
Microsoft .NET platform.

The framework is used by companies around the world.

##### Photography
Whenever I can find the time, I try to [take pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rasmusm)
of nature, family and friends. One of my photos even made it on
[Kris Herman](http://krisherman.com/)'s first CD, I see you see me.
