title: About me 
---

I am a passionate software engineer that likes to do things properly. I stride to maintain
a high quality in all software solutions that I work on, both privately and professionally.
Also, it’s my belief that high quality software is not just about a good performance and
low bug count, but a good overall design, easy to read code and good documentation is
also essential fundaments to maintain a good code base.

Privately I’m a caring person that likes to be with friends and be there when they need me.
